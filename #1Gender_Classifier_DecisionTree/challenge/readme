Find the best model or create a mixed model from scikit learn using the challenge_dataset.csv provided inside the data folder

-=[ Resources ]=-
[dataset] challenge_dataset.csv
[challenge_file] challenge.py

-=[ Tips ]=-
-> Learn how to read csv and convert it to dictionary
-> Learn more about scikit-learn models from their official page
-> Test multiple models

  --- Ex ---
  models = (svm.LinearSVC(C=1.0, max_iter=50000),svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma=0.7, C=1.0),svm.SVC(kernel='poly', degree=3, gamma='auto', C=1.0))
  models = (clf.fit(X, Y) for clf in models)
  predicted = [clf.predict(test_X) for clf in models]
  for _ in predicted:
    accuracy = [(i==j)*1  for i,j in zip(_,Y)]
    print('\tFinal accuracy: {}%\n'.format(sum(accuracy)/len(accuracy)*100))

Nothing for now.
This challenge is just for those who are completely new in programming.
If you create something, don't forget to Tweet me what you have made...
